# Oskar - the Slack satisfaction coach

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wearehanno/oskar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wearehanno/oskar)

## Description

Oskar is a Slackbot that tracks satisfaction of your team members. Every day it asks people how they're doing. This metric is stored in a database and tracked over time, allowing the team to understand which members are struggling or doing extremely well.

Everyone on your team can ask Oskar for another team member's or the entire team's current status. It is not meant to be a way of comparing people but to surface issues, unblock each other and eliminate isolation (especially in remote teams).

## Installing him on Heroku

You can deploy your own copy to Heroku with one click using this button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

See the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) for more info about changing the configuration variables after deployment.

## Using the bot

Oskar automatically asks you two times a day how you're doing. You can reply to him with a number between 1 to 5, and he will then ask you for feedback to know what's the trigger for your current low or high.

All data is collected in a database and made visible via the dashboard, which can be found at the URL:
`http://your-oskar-url.com/dashboard` (find instruction on how to set a username/password below)

You can send the following commands directly to Oskar:
- `How is @member?` - Tells you how a specific team member is doing
- `How is @channel?` - Returns the current status for the whole group

# The App

## Tech stack

- Oskar is build on node.js with express.js.
- It is written in CoffeeScript (such as the node slack client it uses)
- It uses a MongoDB database to store team member feedback
- It (usually, but not only) runs on Heroku

## Configuring Oskar

There are two ways of configuring Oskar.

1) Using local configuration
You copy the contents of the file `config/default.json` and create a new file `config/local.json` with your environment's variables.

2) Using Heroku env variables
Use `.env.sample` to set up your Heroku env variables, either setting them via the command line (as described [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)) or directly from the Heroku panel.

Here's the config variables you need to define:
- `mongo.url` (or `MONGOLAB_URI` for Heroku) defines the url to your MongoDB database (to create a mongoDB on Heroku, go to https://elements.heroku.com/addons/mongolab). This will be automatically generated if you create a MongoLab database as described below ("Setting up Oskar on Heroku") in step 4.
- `slack.token` (or `SLACK_TOKEN` for Heroku) is the token of your team's Slackbot (you can create a new Slackbot here: https://yourteam.slack.com/services/new/bot)

Additionally you can disable specific channels or users:
- `slack.disabledUsers` (or `DISABLED_USERS` for Heroku) to disable **channels** that Oskar is part of (you should disable the default channel that Slack added)
- `slack.disabledChannels` (or `DISABLED_CHANNELS` for Heroku) to disable **users** if you want specific people on your team to not receive any Oskar messages at all

By default your dashboard is protected via a simple HTTP auth mechanism. (we'll try to improve this in the future)
- `auth.username` and `auth.password` (or `AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD` for Heroku) define your login data for the dashboard. Make sure to share those with your team.

See the following instructions if you set up Oskar for the first time.

# Development and Contributing

## Local environment quickstart

- Download and install nodeJS: https://nodejs.org/download/
- Install Grunt: `npm install grunt -g`
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Start the static part of the server without running Oskar: `grunt static`
- You can reach the site at http://localhost:5000
- Compile & watch Sass files: `grunt watch`

## Unit tests

Oskar is being tested with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [should.js](https://github.com/tj/should.js/)

First, we need to install MongoDB if you don't have it running already. Full instructions are [here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/):

    $ brew install mongodb
    # Create a data folder to store MongoDB databases
    $ sudo mkdir -p /data/db
    $ sudo chown $USER /data/db

Now we're running, we can initialise the database:

    $ mongod

Run the unit tests for all modules:

    $ npm test

To run only a single unit test call the test file explicitly, such as `npm test test/inputHelper.coffee`

For the mongo tests to pass, you'll have to run a mongo database under `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

You will need to modify the test parameters in `package.json` under `scripts.test`, to give the test suite a valid Slack API key to test with. We will shortly be updating the repository so that tests can be run on a Slack test account, though.
